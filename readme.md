open-source fork of skyOS 3.0

## description
coffeeOS is a fork of skyOS 3.0 that emerged when webbrowser11 told MicroboyLLC to change skyOS 3.0 to skyOS Java 3.0, but MicroboyLLC refused, so coffeeOS emerged.

## contributing
Just make a fork, and then when you want to push some change(s), make a pull request.
