# coffeeOS readme.md file
open-source fork of skyOS 3.0

## description
coffeeOS is a fork of skyOS 3.0 that emerged when webbrowser11 told MicroboyLLC to change skyOS 3.0 to skyOS Java 3.0, but MicroboyLLC refused, so coffeeOS emerged.

## contributing
Just make a fork, and then when you want to push some change(s), make a pull request.

## more info
This split also happened because webbrowser11 also wanted to get rid of coffeeOD and skyOS 3.0, but now we have coffeeOS, and skyOS 2.x would forever be swarmed by digital ants and flies in the code.
